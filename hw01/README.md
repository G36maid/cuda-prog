# Introduction to CUDA Parallel Programming Homework Assignment 1
March, 2025

## Problem Statement
1. To write your own CPU+GPU code for the modified matrix addition as
defined by c(i,j) = 1/a(i,j) + 1/b(i,j). Setting the input NxN matrices A
and B (where N=6400) with entries of random numbers between 0.0
and 1.0, determine the optimal block size by running your code. You
can use the sample code

twqcp1:/home/cuda_lecture_2025/vecAdd_1GPU/vecAdd.cu as a
template to develop your own code.

## submission

Your homework report should include your source codes, results, and
discussions. The discussion file should be prepared with a typesetting
system, e.g., LaTeX, Word, etc., and it is converted to a PDF file. All
files should be zipped into one gzipped tar file, with a file name
containing your student number and the problem set number
(e.g., r05202043_HW1.tar.gz). Please send your homework with the
title “your_student_number_HW1” to twchiu@phys.ntu.edu.tw
before 17:00, June 11, 2025 (deadline for all problem sets).
