Introduction to CUDA Parallel Programming Homework Assignment 2
March, 2025
1. Write your own CPU+GPU code for finding the trace of a matrix of
real numbers with parallel reduction. You can use the sample code in
twcp1:/home/cuda_lecture_2025/vecDotProduct/vecDot.cu
as template. The input N x N matrix can be generated by the routine
RandomInit with N=6400. Also, determine the optimal block size and
grid size for this problem.
Your homework report should include your source codes, results, and
discussions. The discussion file should be prepared with a typesetting
system, e.g., LaTeX, Word, etc., and it is converted to a PDF file. All
files should be zipped into one gzipped tar file, with a file name
containing your student number and the problem set number (e.g.,
r05202043_HW2.tar.gz). Please send your homework with the title
“your_student_number_HW2” to twchiu@phys.ntu.edu.tw before
17:00, June 11, 2025 (deadline for all problem sets).
