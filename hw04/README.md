Introduction to CUDA Parallel Programming Homework Assignment 4
April, 2025
1. Dot-product
Write your own CUDA code for finding the dot-product of 2 real
vectors with N-GPUs, which generalizes the 1-GPU code in
twcp1:/home/cuda_lecture_2025/vecDotProduct/vecDot.cu
Test your code with 2 GPUs, using random vectors of size 40960000
elements generated by the routine RandomInit. Also, determine the
optimal block size and grid size for this problem.
As usual, your homework report should include your source codes,
results, and discussions (without *.exe files). The discussion file should
be prepared with a typesetting system, e.g., LaTeX, Word, etc., and it
is converted to a PDF file. All files should be zipped into one gzipped
tar file, with a file name containing your student number and the
problem set number (e.g., r05202043_ps4.tar.gz). Please send your
homework with the title “your_student_number_HW4” to
twchiu@phys.ntu.edu.tw before 17:00, June 11, 2025 (deadline for all
problem sets).
